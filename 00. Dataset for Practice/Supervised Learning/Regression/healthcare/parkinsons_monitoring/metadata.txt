Parkinsons Telemonitoring Data Set  
===========================================================
Number of Instances:  5875
Number of Attributes:  26
===========================================================

DATA SET INFORMATION:

This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 42 people with early-stage Parkinson's disease recruited to a six-month trial of a telemonitoring device for remote symptom progression monitoring. The recordings were automatically captured in the patient's homes.

Columns in the table contain subject number, subject age, subject gender, time interval from baseline recruitment date, motor UPDRS, total UPDRS, and 16 biomedical voice measures. Each row corresponds to one of 5,875 voice recording from these individuals. The main aim of the data is to predict the total UPDRS scores ('total_UPDRS') from the 16 voice measures.

The data is in ASCII CSV format. 

===========================================================

ATTRIBUTE INFORMATION:

subject# - Integer that uniquely identifies each subject
age - Subject age
sex - Subject gender '0' - male, '1' - female
test_time - Time since recruitment into the trial. The integer part is the number of days since recruitment.
motor_UPDRS - Clinician's motor UPDRS score, linearly interpolated
Jitter(%),Jitter(Abs),Jitter:RAP,Jitter:PPQ5,Jitter:DDP - Several measures of variation in fundamental frequency
Shimmer,Shimmer(dB),Shimmer:APQ3,Shimmer:APQ5,Shimmer:APQ11,Shimmer:DDA - Several measures of variation in amplitude
NHR,HNR - Two measures of ratio of noise to tonal components in the voice
RPDE - A nonlinear dynamical complexity measure
DFA - Signal fractal scaling exponent
PPE - A nonlinear measure of fundamental frequency variation
