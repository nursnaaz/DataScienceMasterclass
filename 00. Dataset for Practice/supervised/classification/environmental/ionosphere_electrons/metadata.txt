Classification of radar returns from the ionosphere 

   This radar data was collected by a system in Goose Bay, Labrador.  This
   system consists of a phased array of 16 high-frequency antennas with a
   total transmitted power on the order of 6.4 kilowatts.  See the paper
   for more details.  The targets were free electrons in the ionosphere.
   "Good" radar returns are those showing evidence of some type of structure 
   in the ionosphere.  "Bad" returns are those that do not; their signals pass
   through the ionosphere.  

   Received signals were processed using an autocorrelation function whose
   arguments are the time of a pulse and the pulse number.  There were 17
   pulse numbers for the Goose Bay system.  Instances in this databse are
   described by 2 attributes per pulse number, corresponding to the complex
   values returned by the function resulting from the complex electromagnetic
   signal.


Attribute Information:     
   -- All 34 are continuous, as described above

Target:
   -- The 35th attribute is either "good" or "bad" according to the definition
      summarized above.  This is a binary classification task.
