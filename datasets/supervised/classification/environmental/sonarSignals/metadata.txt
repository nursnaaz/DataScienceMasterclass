NAME: Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks

SUMMARY: This is the data set used by Gorman and Sejnowski in their study
of the classification of sonar signals.  The
task is to train a network to discriminate between sonar signals bounced
off a metal cylinder and those bounced off a roughly cylindrical rock.

Instances: 208
Features: 61

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

111 patterns obtained by bouncing sonar
signals off a metal cylinder at various angles and under various
conditions.  97 patterns obtained from
rocks under similar conditions.  The transmitted sonar signal is a
frequency-modulated chirp, rising in frequency.  The data set contains
signals obtained from a variety of different aspect angles, spanning 90
degrees for the cylinder and 180 degrees for the rock.

Attribute info:

Each pattern is a set of 60 numbers in the range 0.0 to 1.0.  
Each number represents the energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over
a certain period of time.  The integration aperture for higher frequencies
occur later in time, since these frequencies are transmitted later during
the chirp.

Target:
The label associated with each record contains the letter "R" if the object
is a rock and "M" if it is a mine (metal cylinder).  

The numbers in the labels are in increasing order of aspect angle, but they do not encode the
angle directly.
